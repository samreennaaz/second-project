<h2>About us</h2>
Collaboration is the process of two or more people or organizations working together to realize or achieve something successfully
Collaboration is very similar to, but more closely aligned than, cooperation.
Most collaboration requires leadership, although the form of leadership can be social within a decentralized and egalitarian group.
Teams that work collaboratively can obtain greater resources, recognition and reward when facing competition for finite resources.
